## Bangkit Capstone Project 2023

Bangkit Capstone Team ID : CH2-PS309 <br>
Theme : Education, Learning, and Personal Developmen <br>
Here is our repository for Bangkit 2022 Capstone project. Our team consist of 3 Machine Learning, 2 Cloud Computing, and 2 Mobile Development.

## About
Tujuan will support individuals, especially students aiming to pursue higher education. in discovering their interests that align with their true selves. Tujuan is a platform that provides recommendations for majors and campuses for high school/vocational school students based on the grades achieved at school and each person's personality. This project will utilize Machine Learning technology to analyze students' interests, preferences, and tendencies based on provided data. 

We raise this issue because there are still many high school students who are still confused about deciding their future, especially about the major they will take in the university. It is oftenly tough for students in Indonesia to decide their major because of some factors such as lack of information about the major, not knowing the potentials, interests, and SWOT of their own. Considering that the problems mentioned above need to be solved, we are confident that Tujuan is the answer we need. Tujuan will ease the nation's next generation to determine their future, efficiency in choosing a major, and reducing feelings of wrongness in choosing a major.

## Machine Learning
Building models with Neural Networks. Using pandas and stored in a DataFrame, The dataset is split into training and testing sets using functions from scikit-learn and preprocess the data using One-hot encoding to convert categorical tables into a numerical format.
